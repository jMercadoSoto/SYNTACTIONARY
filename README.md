Project Challenges and General Solutions (Android Version):
-

  Problem 1: When Python program scrapes the different news websites, if the news editors use different labels such as div or p, the program will only scrape the specific labels.<br>
  Solution: At this movement, I only deal with BBC news which the specific news website.<br>
  
  Problem 2: How the program saves all the data include the artile text file, hard level and easy level words database, correct answers database, and user input database.<br>
  Solution: In the android version software, all the data is stored to local host data base. I am considering to put the data to the cloud database, but I am not go that far. Will considere to make a online database to make the programm more efficient.<br>
